0.03: BLE Fix + App Loader Compatibility (2025-01-12)
- FIXED: BLE transmission now uses Bluetooth.println() instead of NRF.send()
- Now sends data via proper Nordic UART Service (UUID 6e400002/6e400003)
- Live data streaming to Flutter app working
- Added debug logging every 10 readings
- Updated metadata.json for BangleApps App Loader compatibility
- Added data wildcard for CSV files in metadata
- Format: lib.js → "pulsewatch" (no extension) for proper require()

INTEGRATION REVIEW - Flutter App ✅
- ble_service.dart: Correctly subscribes to Nordic UART RX (UUID 6e400003)
- Parses 6-field CSV format: timestamp,bpm,confidence,accel_x,accel_y,accel_z
- Saves to database immediately with insertHeartRateWithTimestamp() and insertAccelerometerWithTimestamp()
- Updates UI with live status: "Live HR: X BPM • Y readings"
- today_screen.dart: Auto-refreshes every 5 seconds to show Signal Score, Min/Avg/Max HR
- insights_screen.dart: Shows weekly activity summary and data quality metrics
- database_helper.dart: Schema verified correct with proper indexes

USAGE NOTES:
- Recording must be manually enabled on watch (RECORD toggle in PulseWatch menu) before data transmission begins
- Watch will show green dot widget indicator when recording is active
- Flutter app will show live readings counter when receiving data
- Debug messages on watch console every 10 readings for monitoring

0.02: Added control interface
- App now appears in launcher menu
- View status (recording state, file count, storage used)
- View statistics (detailed info)
- Delete data manually (for testing)
- Toggle recording on/off
- Green dot widget indicator

0.01: Initial release
- Background heart rate monitoring
- Accelerometer data collection
- Automatic 5-minute interval saves (testing)
- Green dot widget indicator
- Silent operation - no user interaction needed
